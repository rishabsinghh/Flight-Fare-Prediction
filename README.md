# Flight-Fare-Prediction

# Problem Statement
Travelling through flights has become an integral part of todayâ€™s lifestyle as more and more people are opting for faster travelling options. The flight ticket prices increase or decrease every now and then depending on various factors like timing of the flights, destination, and duration of flights various occasions such as vacations or festive season. Therefore, having some basic idea of the flight fares before planning the trip will surely help many people save money and time.
The main goal is to predict the fares of the flights based on different factors available in the provided dataset.

# Data
Data is obtained from Kaggle.  https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh

Data contains, 10683 rows with a total of 11 features. 
1)Airline- The Airline Company
2)Date_of_Journey-Self Explanatory
3)Source-The Departure City
4)Destination-The Arrival City
5)Dep_Time-Time of take off, The time at which the flight departs
6)Arrival_Time-Time of Landing. The time at which the flight arrives at the source.
7)Route-The Route between the two cities with stops
8)Duration-The Total time taken from the Source to Destination including the halt time
9)Total Stops-No.of halts between the source and destination.
10)Additional Info- any additional services, meals,etc.
11)Price- The target variable, the cost of the flight.

# Preprocssing

The Data Required a fair amount of cleaning and preprocessing. Firstly, the date was in string format, so it had to be converted to date_time format. Next if we closely observe the relation between our target variable and date, we can derive two more features from it. One being, The Month, which will tell us in which month most flights fly and also in which month price is the most. Second being, The week, What part of the week have the most flights and how does it affect price?

Next, we have to deal with Departure time and Arrival time. We first have to split the data into Hours and Minutes. From here we can derive a feature which will tell us what time of the day most of the flights fly. i.e, Day, Afternoon, Evening, and Night for both Departure time and Arrival Time.

We split the Duration also in Hours and minutes. Then we convert total stops to numeric feature by just taking the digit which indicates the total number of stops.
The Cateogrical features left are Source,Destination, and Airline. All of them are ordinal, hence we encode them using LabelEncoder.
There was only one missing value, hence we dropped them from the databse. 
We drop the Route and Additional info features since it didn't add much value to our target variable.

# Model Building
For this I used one Bagging Technique and One boosting Technique. Since it was a regression problem, i used r2_score as a metric to decide which model is better. I used clustering using Kmeans for training models on different subsets of data for better accuracy. The Models were used XG_Boost Regressor and RandomForestRegressor. I got an accuracy of 81% with XGRegressor for all my clusters.

# Model Deployment
I used Streamlit(It's an amazing tool for UI) for the UI. I deployed the entire project on Heroku(again very easy to use cloud platform).

# Conclusion
This is a very nice problem for learning EDA and getting Insights of the data. There are many more variations of this, i would highly recommend to check out Kaggle notebooks on this, because alot can be done over this Problem.
